Go Play Ground
  
  - [CRUD Simulation](https://go.dev/play/p/TwxzrQuMsAa)
  - [CRUD Simulation Dependency Injection (DI)](https://go.dev/play/p/_9OvbLFoZc9)
  - [Simplicity Simulation file system in-memory](https://go.dev/play/p/jdXwwfBHifz)

### My Go Toolkit:

- `gotoolchain auto`: Automated management of Go tools.
- `golint` & `gopls`: Essential for code linting and editor integration.
- `deadcode`: Removes unused code to maintain a clean codebase.
- `gotests`: Automates the generation of test cases.
- `go doc` & `go fmt`: Ensures consistent documentation and code formatting.
- `go vet`: Provides in-depth code analysis.
- `gocyclo`: Measures and aims to reduce cyclomatic complexity.
- `pprof`: A powerful profiling tool for measuring and visualizing the performance characteristics of Go programs, particularly adept at identifying resource-intensive operations.

### All these tools are excellent and can help create high-quality Go code with minimal complexity.

> [!TIP]
> When writing in Go:

**Coding Philosophy:**
- Prioritize error handling first before structuring logs.
- Strive for simplicity in each function, aiming for a cyclomatic complexity under 5 as a sign of Go programming expertise.
- As a general rule, maintain a maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10. If you have advanced expertise, aim for a cyclomatic complexity under 5.
- Emphasize reusable code as it encourages better testing practices, enhances readability for both `humans` and `machines`, and aids in minimizing bugs for more reliable code.
- Utilize constants in Go as a minimalist approach to avoid the pitfalls of stupid hard coding values.

**By adhering to these principles, your Go code will stand out as superior when compared to others.**

For example, even when using other packages, you'll find that your own package, built upon these principles, is superior. It will be less complex, have fewer bugs, and cause fewer panics compared to other packages that may be unnecessarily complex or prone to issues.


> [!TIP]
> Another tips, this most important when you are writing in `go` witthen `cyclomatic complexity under 5`, especialy when you wanted to push in `github` for `repository`

- Ignore Go test files (e.g, `yourfunction_test.go`) by adding them to `.gitignore`.

Because, just think again, why you have to push include `go` code test files when `cyclomatic complexity` are under `5` ? so be smart `cyclomatic complexity under 5` you are `go` mastery.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to keep the cyclomatic complexity to a maximum of `10` or lower (ideally under `5`). This is because, in `Go`, unlike `Python` which may tolerate complex conditional logic (e.g., multiple nested `if` statements which is bad), functions with a complexity under `10` are more likely to be `reusable`. This not only aids in `testing` but also enhances `human + machine readability` and `minimizes bugs (bug-free)`.

âš¡ Fun fact

***Did You Know?*** If your `Go` code resembles a jungle of `if` statements (think 10+ nested layers â€“ a big no-no!), it's less `Go` and more `Stop-and-ask-for-directions`. Flatten those conditionals and let your code run as smoothly as a greased `gopher` on a slip 'n slide!

***Did You Know?*** If your code is overly stupid complex, it could indicate a need for improvement in your development skills.
