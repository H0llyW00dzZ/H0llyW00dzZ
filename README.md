### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



### My Signature (By Machine Learning + AI where we so deep in binary)


$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \cdot \text{H0llyW00dzZ}_{i=1}^{tm} x_i + E=mc^2 + \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

  - [CRUD Simulation](https://go.dev/play/p/TwxzrQuMsAa)
  - [CRUD Simulation Dependency Injection (DI)](https://go.dev/play/p/_9OvbLFoZc9)
  - [Simplicity Simulation file system in-memory](https://go.dev/play/p/jdXwwfBHifz)

### My Go Toolkit:

- `gotoolchain auto`: Automated management of Go tools.
- `golint` & `gopls`: Essential for code linting and editor integration.
- `deadcode`: Removes unused code to maintain a clean codebase.
- `gotests`: Automates the generation of test cases.
- `go doc` & `go fmt`: Ensures consistent documentation and code formatting.
- `go vet`: Provides in-depth code analysis.
- `gocyclo`: Measures and aims to reduce cyclomatic complexity.


### All these tools are excellent and can help create high-quality Go code with minimal complexity.

> [!TIP]
> When writing in Go:

**Coding Philosophy:**
- Prioritize error handling first before structuring logs.
- Strive for simplicity in each function (aim for a cyclomatic complexity under 5 to demonstrate expertise); simplicity is a sign of Go programming mastery.
- Keep maximum of cyclomatic complexity as `10` unless you are expert then aim cyclomatic complexity under `5`
- Emphasizing reusable code encourages better testing practices, enhances readability for `human` and `machines`, and `minimizes bugs (bug-free)`.

> [!TIP]
> Another tips, this most important when you are writing in `go` witthen `cyclomatic complexity under 5`, especialy when you wanted to push in `github` for `repository`

- Ignore Go test files (e.g, `yourfunction_test.go`) by adding them to `.gitignore`.

Because, just think again, why you have to push include `go` code test files when `cyclomatic complexity` are under `5` ? so be smart `cyclomatic complexity under 5` you are `go` mastery.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to keep the cyclomatic complexity to a maximum of `10` or lower (ideally under `5`). This is because, in `Go`, unlike `Python` which may tolerate complex conditional logic (e.g., multiple nested `if` statements which is bad), functions with a complexity under `10` are more likely to be `reusable`. This not only aids in `testing` but also enhances `human + machine readability` and `minimizes bugs (bug-free)`.

âš¡ Fun fact

***Did You Know?*** If your `Go` code is a jungle of `if` statements, it's less `Go` and more `Stop-and-ask-for-directions`. Flatten those conditionals and let your code run as smoothly as a greased `gopher` on a slip 'n slide!
